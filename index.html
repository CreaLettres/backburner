        <h1>Backburner</h1>

<p>Backburner is a <a href="http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd/">beanstalkd</a>-powered job queue that can handle a very high volume of jobs.
You create background jobs and place them on multiple work queues to be processed later.</p>

<p>Processing background jobs reliably has never been easier than with beanstalkd and Backburner. This gem works with any ruby-based
web framework, but is especially suited for use with <a href="http://sinatrarb.com">Sinatra</a>, <a href="http://padrinorb.com">Padrino</a> and Rails.</p>

<p>If you want to use beanstalk for your job processing, consider using Backburner.
Backburner is heavily inspired by Resque and DelayedJob. Backburner stores all jobs as simple JSON message payloads.
Backburner can be a persistent queue when the beanstalk persistence mode is enabled.
It supports multiple queues, priorities, delays, and timeouts.</p>

<h2>Why Backburner?</h2>

<p>Backburner is well tested and has a familiar, no-nonsense approach to job processing, but that is of secondary importance.
Let's face it, there are a lot of options for background job processing. <a href="https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job">DelayedJob</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/resque">Resque</a> are the first that come to mind immediately. So, how do we make sense
of which one to use? And why use Backburner over other alternatives?</p>

<p>The key to understanding the differences lies in understanding the different projects and protocols that power these popular queue
libraries under the hood. Every job queue requires a queue store that jobs are put into and pulled out of.
In the case of Resque, jobs are processed through <strong>Redis</strong>, a persistent key-value store. In the case of DelayedJob, jobs are processed through
<strong>ActiveRecord</strong> and a database such as PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>The work queue underlying these gems tells you infinitely more about the differences than anything else.
Beanstalk is probably the best solution for job queues available today for many reasons.
The real question then is... "Why Beanstalk?".</p>

<h2>Why Beanstalk?</h2>

<p>Illya has an excellent blog post
<a href="http://www.igvita.com/2010/05/20/scalable-work-queues-with-beanstalk/">Scalable Work Queues with Beanstalk</a> and
Adam Wiggins posted <a href="http://adam.heroku.com/past/2010/4/24/beanstalk_a_simple_and_fast_queueing_backend/">an excellent comparison</a>.</p>

<p>You will quickly see that <strong>beanstalkd</strong> is an underrated but incredible project that is extremely well-suited as a job queue.
Significantly better suited for this task than Redis or a database. Beanstalk is a simple,
and a very fast work queue service rolled into a single binary - it is the memcached of work queues.
Originally built to power the backend for the 'Causes' Facebook app, it is a mature and production ready open source project.
<a href="http://www.postrank.com">PostRank</a> uses beanstalk to reliably process millions of jobs a day.</p>

<p>A single instance of Beanstalk is perfectly capable of handling thousands of jobs a second (or more, depending on your job size)
because it is an in-memory, event-driven system. Powered by libevent under the hood,
it requires zero setup (launch and forget, à la memcached), optional log based persistence, an easily parsed ASCII protocol,
and a rich set of tools for job management that go well beyond a simple FIFO work queue.</p>

<p>Beanstalk supports the following features natively, out of the box, without any questions asked:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Parallel Queues</strong> - Supports multiple work queues created on demand.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reliable</strong> - Beanstalk’s reserve, work, delete cycle ensures reliable processing.</li>
<li>
<strong>Scheduling</strong> - Delay enqueuing jobs by a specified interval to schedule processing later.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fast</strong> - Processes thousands of jobs per second; <strong>significantly</strong> <a href="http://adam.heroku.com/past/2010/4/24/beanstalk_a_simple_and_fast_queueing_backend">faster than alternatives</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Priorities</strong> - Specify priority so important jobs can be processed quickly.</li>
<li>
<strong>Persistence</strong> - Jobs are stored in memory for speed, but logged to disk for safe keeping.</li>
<li>
<strong>Federation</strong> - Horizontal scalability provided through federation by the client.</li>
<li>
<strong>Buried jobs</strong> - Bury any job which causes an error for later debugging and inspection.</li>
</ul><p>Keep in mind that these features are supported out of the box with beanstalk and require no special code within this gem to support.
In the end, <strong>beanstalk is the ideal job queue</strong> while also being ridiculously easy to install and setup.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>First, you probably want to <a href="http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd/download.html">install beanstalkd</a>, which powers the job queues.
Depending on your platform, this should be as simple as (for Ubuntu):</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install beanstalkd
</code></pre>

<p>Add this line to your application's Gemfile:</p>

<pre><code>gem 'backburner'
</code></pre>

<p>And then execute:</p>

<pre><code>$ bundle
</code></pre>

<p>Or install it yourself as:</p>

<pre><code>$ gem install backburner
</code></pre>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>Backburner is extremely simple to setup. Just configure basic settings for backburner:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="no">Backburner</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">configure</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">beanstalk_url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"beanstalk://127.0.0.1"</span>
  <span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">tube_namespace</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">"some.app.production"</span>
  <span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">on_error</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">lambda</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">e</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">e</span> <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">default_priority</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">65536</span>
  <span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">respond_timeout</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">120</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Backburner allows you to create jobs and place them on a beanstalk queue, and later pull those jobs off the queue and
process them asynchronously.</p>

<h3>Enqueuing Jobs</h3>

<p>At the core, Backburner is about jobs that can be processed. Jobs are simple ruby objects with a method defined named <code>perform</code>.</p>

<p>Any object which responds to <code>perform</code> can be queued as a job. Job objects are queued as JSON to be later processed by a task runner.
Here's an example:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">NewsletterJob</span>
  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">Backburner</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Queue</span>
  <span class="n">queue</span> <span class="s2">"newsletter"</span>  <span class="c1"># defaults to 'newsletter-job'</span>
  <span class="n">queue_priority</span> <span class="mi">1000</span> <span class="c1"># most urgent priority is 0</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">perform</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">email</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">body</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="no">NewsletterMailer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">deliver_text_to_email</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">email</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">body</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Notice that you can include the optional <code>Backburner::Queue</code> module so you can specify a <code>queue</code> name for this job.
Jobs can be enqueued with:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="no">Backburner</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">enqueue</span> <span class="no">NewsletterJob</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'foo@admin.com'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'lorem ipsum...'</span>
</pre></div>

<p><code>Backburner.enqueue</code> accepts first a ruby object that supports <code>perform</code> and then a series of parameters
to that object's <code>perform</code> method. The queue name used by default is the normalized class name (i.e <code>{namespace}.newsletter-job</code>)
if not otherwise specified.</p>

<h3>Simple Async Jobs</h3>

<p>In addition to defining custom jobs, a job can also be enqueued by invoking the <code>async</code> method on any object which
includes <code>Backburner::Performable</code>. Async enqueuing works for both instance and class methods on any <em>performable</em> object.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">User</span>
  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">Backburner</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Performable</span>
  <span class="n">queue</span> <span class="s2">"user-jobs"</span>  <span class="c1"># defaults to 'user'</span>
  <span class="n">queue_priority</span> <span class="mi">500</span> <span class="c1"># most urgent priority is 0</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">activate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">device_id</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="vi">@device</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Device</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">device_id</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="c1"># ...</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">reset_password</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">user_id</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="c1"># ...</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="c1"># Async works for instance methods on a persisted model</span>
<span class="vi">@user</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">User</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">first</span>
<span class="vi">@user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">async</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:ttr</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:queue</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"activate"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">activate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="vi">@device</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1"># ..as well as for class methods</span>
<span class="no">User</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">async</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:pri</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:delay</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">seconds</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">reset_password</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="vi">@user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">id</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This will automatically enqueue a job for that user record that will run <code>activate</code> with the specified argument.
Note that you can set the queue name and queue priority at the class level and 
you are also able to pass <code>pri</code>, <code>ttr</code>, <code>delay</code> and <code>queue</code> directly as options into <code>async</code>. 
The queue name used by default is the normalized class name (i.e <code>{namespace}.user</code>) if not otherwise specified.</p>

<h3>Working Jobs</h3>

<p>Backburner workers are processes that run forever handling jobs that get reserved. Starting a worker in ruby code is simple:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="no">Backburner</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">work</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This will process jobs in all queues but you can also restrict processing to specific queues:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="no">Backburner</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">work</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'newsletter_sender'</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The Backburner worker also exists as a rake task:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'backburner/tasks'</span>
</pre></div>

<p>so you can run:</p>

<pre><code>$ QUEUES=newsletter-sender,push-message rake backburner:work
</code></pre>

<p>You can also run the backburner binary for a convenient worker:</p>

<pre><code>bundle exec backburner newsletter-sender,push-message -d -P /var/run/backburner.pid -l /var/log/backburner.log
</code></pre>

<p>This will daemonize the worker and store the pid and logs automatically.</p>

<h3>Default Queues</h3>

<p>Workers can be easily restricted to processing only a specific set of queues as shown above. However, if you want a worker to
process <strong>all</strong> queues instead, then you can leave the queue list blank.</p>

<p>When you execute a worker without queues specified, any queue for a known job queue class with <code>include Backburner::Queue</code> will be processed.
To access the list of known queue classes, you can use:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="no">Backburner</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Worker</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">known_queue_classes</span>
<span class="c1"># =&gt; [NewsletterJob, SomeOtherJob]</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Dynamic queues created by passing queue options <strong>will not be processed</strong> by a default worker. For this reason, you may want to take control over the default list of
queues processed when none are specified. To do this, you can use the <code>default_queues</code> class method:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="no">Backburner</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">default_queues</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">concat</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">"foo"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"bar"</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>

<p>This will ensure that the <em>foo</em> and <em>bar</em> queues are processed by default. You can also add job queue names:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="no">Backburner</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">default_queues</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="no">NewsletterJob</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">queue</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>default_queues</code> stores the specific list of queues that should be processed by default by a worker.</p>

<h3>Failures</h3>

<p>You can setup the error handler for jobs using configure:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="no">Backburner</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">configure</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">on_error</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">lambda</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">ex</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="no">Airbrake</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">notify</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">ex</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Now all beanstalk queue errors will show up on airbrake.
If a job fails in beanstalk, the job is automatically buried and must be 'kicked' later.</p>

<h3>Logging</h3>

<p>Right now, all logging happens to standard out and can be piped to a file or any other output manually. More on logging coming later.</p>

<h3>Web Front-end</h3>

<p>Be sure to check out the Sinatra-powered project <a href="https://github.com/denniskuczynski/beanstalkd_view">beanstalkd_view</a> 
by <a href="http://github.com/denniskuczynski">denniskuczynski</a> which provides an excellent overview of the tubes and
jobs processed by your beanstalk workers. An excellent addition to your Backburner setup.</p>

<h3>Workers in Production</h3>

<p>Once you have Backburner setup in your application, starting workers is really easy. Once <a href="http://kr.github.com/beanstalkd/download.html">beanstalkd</a>
is installed, your best bet is to use the built-in rake task that comes with Backburner. Simply add the task to your Rakefile:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1"># Rakefile</span>
<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'backburner/tasks'</span>
</pre></div>

<p>and then you can start the rake task with:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>rake backburner:work
<span class="nv">$ QUEUES</span><span class="o">=</span>newsletter-sender,push-message rake backburner:work
</pre></div>

<p>The best way to deploy these rake tasks is using a monitoring library. We suggest <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/god/">God</a>
which watches processes and ensures their stability. A simple God recipe for Backburner can be found in
<a href="https://github.com/nesquena/backburner/blob/master/examples/god.rb">examples/god</a>.</p>
